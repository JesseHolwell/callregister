# callregister
A WPF app I made for a friend to use in their management role of a call center.
The goal of the application is to allow the call center to observe common and recurring issues and take action to prevent the issue at the source.

There were strict technical limitation on the deployment of this application.
I decided to use a MS Access database on a shared drive to allow for a lightweight installation while giving everyone access.

Data is managed through the settings window which requires a login (hint: admin admin)
